Python is a general purpose, high-level, interpreted programming language developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s,
at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands.

When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”, 
a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.
